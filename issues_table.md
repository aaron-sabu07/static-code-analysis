|---|-------|------|---------|------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Mutable default argument | Bug | 7 | Pylint (W0102) | `logs=[]` was shared across function calls, causing data to persist between calls | High | Changed default to `None` and initialize `logs = []` inside function |
| 2 | Bare except clause | Code Quality | 14-17 | Pylint (W0702), Flake8 (E722) | Using `except:` catches all exceptions including SystemExit and KeyboardInterrupt | Medium | Replaced with specific `except KeyError:` and `except TypeError:` |
| 3 | Use of eval() | Security | 48 | Bandit (B307) | `eval()` executes arbitrary code - major security vulnerability | Critical | Completely removed eval() call |
| 4 | File not closed properly | Code Quality | 24, 29 | Pylint (R1732) | Files opened without context manager may not close if exception occurs | Medium | Used `with open()` context manager for automatic cleanup |
| 5 | KeyError not handled | Bug | 21 | Runtime Risk | `getQty()` crashes if item doesn't exist in dictionary | Medium | Used `.get(item, 0)` method with default value |
| 6 | Unused import | Style | 2 | Flake8 (F401) | `logging` imported but never used | Low | Removed unused import statement |
| 7 | String formatting | Style | 12 | Pylint (C0209) | Old-style % formatting is less readable | Low | Replaced with f-strings for cleaner code |
| 8 | No input validation | Logic | 41-42 | Manual Review | Function accepts invalid inputs (negative numbers, wrong types) | Medium | Added type checking and validation with error messages |
| 9 | Missing encoding | Best Practice | 24, 29 | Pylint (W1514) | File opened without explicit encoding | Low | Added `encoding="utf-8"` parameter |
| 10 | Global variable usage | Design | Multiple | Pylint (W0603) | Using global statement for stock_data | Low | Documented with comment; acceptable for this simple program |
| 11 | Function naming | Style | Multiple | Pylint (C0103) | Functions use camelCase instead of snake_case | Low | Renamed all functions: addItem→add_item, removeItem→remove_item, etc. |
| 12 | Missing module docstring | Style | 1 | Pylint (C0114) | No docstring at module level | Low | Added comprehensive module docstring |
| 13 | Trailing whitespace | Style | Multiple | Pylint (C0303), Flake8 (W293) | Extra spaces at end of lines | Low | Removed all trailing whitespace |
| 14 | Blank line spacing | Style | Multiple | Flake8 (E302, E305) | Need 2 blank lines between functions | Low | Added proper spacing per PEP 8 |
